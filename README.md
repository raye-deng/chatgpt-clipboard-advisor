ChatGPT clipboard advisor is a chatbot based on ChatGPT-3.5 that provides suggestions based on your clipboard content. 

I believe that chat and AI should be able to integrate and be used anywhere, not just limited to browsers or certain applications. 
The system clipboard is a great integration point, so I developed this little tool.

## How to use
You can use this tool to get suggestions about your clipboard content. 
After copying your question or topic anywhere, use the shortcut key ctrl / command + q to get suggestions. 
The tool will notify you of the request's status and results through the notification bar, as shown in the figure.

You can download the installation package for Mac on the release page (currently only Mac version is available, and Windows version will be considered in the future).

## How to configure
Of course, before use, you need an API key from OpenAI. Please Google for the specific application process.
